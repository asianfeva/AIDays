## Accessing the prediction endpoint using REST API

In this step, you will learn how to access the REST prediction endpoint that was created by Custom Vision Service as a wrapper around your model. The instructor will explain in detail what the prediction endpoint is and will walk you through `predict.ipynb` Jupyter notebook that illustrates how to use Python SDK to access the service.

1. Make sure to mark the current version of your model as the default iteration.

2. Connect to Jupyter server on your Data Science Virtual Machine
https://<VM IP address>:8000
  You may receive a warning that your connection is not private. Ignore it and press **ADVANCE** to proceed.

3. Start the `predict.ipynb` notebook located in `AIDays/DeveloperTrack/01-CustomVisionService`

3. After you have completed the walkthroug of `predict.ipynb` procedd to the [next step](export.md)

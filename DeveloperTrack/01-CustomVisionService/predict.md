## Accessing the prediction endpoint using REST API

In this step, you will learn how to access the REST prediction endpoint that was created by Custom Vision Service as a wrapper around your model. The instructor will explain in detail what the prediction endpoint is and will walk you through `invoke_endpoint.ipynb` Jupyter notebook that illustrates how to use Python SDK to access the service.

1. Make sure to mark the current version of your model as the default iteration.

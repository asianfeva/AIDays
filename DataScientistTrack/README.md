# Data Science Track

This folder contains hands-on labs that demonstrate how to develop and operationalize custom AI/ML models using Azure AI Machine Learning services: Azure Databricks and Azure Machine Learning service. **The labs are designed to be led by an instructor.**  They can be used for self-study but the commentary is terse and it is expected
that the instructor will walk participants through the lab, deep dive into the code, and answer any arising questions. The labs are independent and self-contained and can be executed in arbitrary combinations.
